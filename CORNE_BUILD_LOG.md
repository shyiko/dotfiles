I recommend getting [PCB Kit from littlekeyboards](https://www.littlekeyboards.com/products/corne-mx-hotswap-kit) as it includes pretty much everything you'll need except 
- 2 microcontrollers (e.g. [Elite-C](https://keeb.io/collections/frontpage/products/elite-c-usb-c-pro-micro-replacement-arduino-compatible-atmega32u4?variant=31151566422110) v3.0 or newer)
- [Mill Max 315-93-164-41-003000 sockets](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/315-93-164-41-003000/ED4864-64-ND/279656/) (I bought them from [here](https://www.littlekeyboards.com/products/mill-max-ultra-low-profile-sockets); you'll need 2 x 12pin for each microcontroller) + [Mill Max 3320-0-00-15-00-00-03-0 pins](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/3320-0-00-15-00-00-03-0/ED1134-ND/4147392) (24 for each microcontroller)
- [TRRS cable](https://zapcables.com/diy-trrs-cable-kit/) ([sample pack](https://zapcables.com/sleeving-sample-pack/))
- [USB Type-C cable](https://zapcables.com/diy-usb-cable-kit/) ([sample pack](https://zapcables.com/sleeving-sample-pack/))
- [case](https://www.littlekeyboards.com/collections/catalog/products/corne-analyst-case) (this one comes with screws & 8mm standoffs)
- 42 keyswitches ([Cherry MX Brown](https://novelkeys.xyz/collections/switches/products/cherry-switches) is a good starting point)
- [40 1u + 2 1.25u](https://thomasbaart.nl/2019/02/10/keycap-count-by-size-and-row-for-ansi-and-iso/) [keycaps](https://kbdfans.com/search?type=product&q=blank+KEYCAP)  
- [HI MARK Tactile Pen](https://lifehacker.com/for-faster-touch-typing-put-a-bump-on-your-keyboard-1796456723) (for f/j tactile bumps; optional)
- 12+ [7*1.5mm self-adhesive silicone feet](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000439059508.html) (optional as the case I linked above comes with clear silicone feet)

Firmware can be found [here](https://github.com/shyiko/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/crkbd/keymaps/shyiko) (see [referrences](https://github.com/shyiko/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/crkbd/keymaps/shyiko#references) for more).
